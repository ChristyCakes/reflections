What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    Fill in your answer here

Automatic saving sounds safest. Choosing when might be good way to keep track of changes better in your memory.



Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
 files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    Fill in your answer here



Saving multiple files is important when the files are related or depend on each other. Changing one will change the other, so you'd need information from the others as well, even if they weren't changed.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    Fill in your answer here

Git log shows all committs (changes). Git diff compares two specific commits.



How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?
