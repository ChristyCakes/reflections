When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
A remote repository provides access to the files from any computer with internet. You may want to use that if you'll be at a different computer or if someone else is working on the project. Or you'd rather store it online for space issues or backup security.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
You may want to pull only certain commits or branches. You may want to work with branches or commits one at a time or in specified groups and pull manually to keep yourself organized.
